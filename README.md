## E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

 Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This is the starting point for building an awesome e-commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

What's This Project About?

We're diving into creating a full-fledged e-commerce app from scratch. Along the way, you'll pick up real-world development skills, from backend to frontend, and get comfy with REST APIs, databases, and user authentication.
Cool Features We're Adding

MERN Stack: Full-stack development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

REST API Development: Build APIs to handle different parts of the app like user accounts, products, and orders.

Authentication: Create secure sign-up and login flows for users.

Database Design: Plan out how the data will be structured and stored in MongoDB.

Backend Development: Get the server side of things running smoothly with Node.js and Express.

Frontend: Use React to build a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Key Concepts We'll Cover

MERN Stack Breakdown: Learn how each part (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) fits into the puzzle.

API Building 101: Create endpoints for things like logging in, managing products, and handling orders.

Designing Databases: Sketch out data models and relationships in MongoDB.

Authentication Matters: Protect sensitive parts of the app and manage who gets access to what.

Environment Variables: Senstive data is managed using .env files.
## Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JAvaScript runtime.
Express: Web framework for building RESTFUL APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB.
JsonWebToken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.

The endpoint is responsible for handling user registration. It accepts user details such as name, email, password, and an optional avatar file. It processes the data, hashes the password, and stores the user information in the database.

Features

Handles file uploads for user avatars.

Hashes passwords for secure storage.

Validates input data.

Stores user information, including an avatar, in the database.

Returns a success response with the created user data.


## Milestone 7
In this milestone we simply implemented the logic for login and signup , that is if the user already exists in the database then only he/she will be able to login

## Milestone 8

In this milestone we just create a home page for the products 
## Milestone 9: Project Overview -
In this milestone we have simply created a form named create product to add products to our website. We created it using React.js and tailwind css.
