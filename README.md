## E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

 Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This is the starting point for building an awesome e-commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

What's This Project About?

We're diving into creating a full-fledged e-commerce app from scratch. Along the way, you'll pick up real-world development skills, from backend to frontend, and get comfy with REST APIs, databases, and user authentication.
Cool Features We're Adding

MERN Stack: Full-stack development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

REST API Development: Build APIs to handle different parts of the app like user accounts, products, and orders.

Authentication: Create secure sign-up and login flows for users.

Database Design: Plan out how the data will be structured and stored in MongoDB.

Backend Development: Get the server side of things running smoothly with Node.js and Express.

Frontend: Use React to build a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Key Concepts We'll Cover

MERN Stack Breakdown: Learn how each part (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) fits into the puzzle.

API Building 101: Create endpoints for things like logging in, managing products, and handling orders.

Designing Databases: Sketch out data models and relationships in MongoDB.

Authentication Matters: Protect sensitive parts of the app and manage who gets access to what.
## Milestone2 Project overview
A simple and resoponsive login page using react.



Features
User-Friendly Design: Clean and responsive interface optimized for various screen sizes. Interactive Inputs: Includes interactive input fields for username/email and password. Client-Side Validation: Validates user inputs for required fields and basic patterns.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface. CSS: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness. JavaScript (ES6): Adding interactivity and validation logic within React.

## Milestone 3
This project demonstartes a server application that connects to a database, implements JWT-based authentication, and uses structured error handling.


##Features
Database Connecting: Connects to a MondgoDB database using Mongoose.
JWT Authentication: Secures endpoint with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Error Handling: Centralizes error handling using custom middleware.
Scalable Structurr: Origanized folder structure for better maintainability.
Environment Variables: Senstive data is managed using .env files.
## Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JAvaScript runtime.
Express: Web framework for building RESTFUL APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB.
JsonWebToken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.

## Milestone 4
This project demostrate creating a MongoDB schema, integrating file uploads using 'multer', hashing passwords with bcrypt, parsing request bodies with body-parser and securing routes with JWT-based authentication.


## features

MongoDB Schema: Define and manage MongoDB collections using Mongoose.
File Uploads: Upload and store files using multer.
Password Hashing: Secure user passwords using bcrypt
Body Parsing: Parse incoming request bodies using body-parser.
JWT Authentication: Project routes a manage authentication tokens.

## Technologies Used

Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express: Web framework for building APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
Bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.
Body-Parser: Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data.
jsonwebtoken: Library for creating and verifying JWT tokens.

## Milestone 5 Project Overview -
In this milestone we focused on creating a signup page for new users visiting the website,

## Milestone 6
Overview


The endpoint is responsible for handling user registration. It accepts user details such as name, email, password, and an optional avatar file. It processes the data, hashes the password, and stores the user information in the database.

Features

Handles file uploads for user avatars.

Hashes passwords for secure storage.

Validates input data.

Stores user information, including an avatar, in the database.

Returns a success response with the created user data.


## Milestone 7
In this milestone we simply implemented the logic for login and signup , that is if the user already exists in the database then only he/she will be able to login

## Milestone 8

In this milestone we just create a home page for the products 

## Milestone 9
In this  milestone we have learnt how to create a product page and like we can see the categories of prducts, their names, descriptions and price stock and all other things.

## Miletsone 10
In this milstone we created the end point of the product and use the multer and define the axios in createProduct file to in backend.
