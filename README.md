## E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

 Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This is the starting point for building an awesome e-commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

What's This Project About?

We're diving into creating a full-fledged e-commerce app from scratch. Along the way, you'll pick up real-world development skills, from backend to frontend, and get comfy with REST APIs, databases, and user authentication.
Cool Features We're Adding

MERN Stack: Full-stack development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

REST API Development: Build APIs to handle different parts of the app like user accounts, products, and orders.

Authentication: Create secure sign-up and login flows for users.

Database Design: Plan out how the data will be structured and stored in MongoDB.

Backend Development: Get the server side of things running smoothly with Node.js and Express.

Frontend: Use React to build a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Key Concepts We'll Cover

MERN Stack Breakdown: Learn how each part (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) fits into the puzzle.

API Building 101: Create endpoints for things like logging in, managing products, and handling orders.

Designing Databases: Sketch out data models and relationships in MongoDB.

Authentication Matters: Protect sensitive parts of the app and manage who gets access to what.
