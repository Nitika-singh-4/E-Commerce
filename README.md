## E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

 Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This is the starting point for building an awesome e-commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

What's This Project About?

We're diving into creating a full-fledged e-commerce app from scratch. Along the way, you'll pick up real-world development skills, from backend to frontend, and get comfy with REST APIs, databases, and user authentication.
Cool Features We're Adding

MERN Stack: Full-stack development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

REST API Development: Build APIs to handle different parts of the app like user accounts, products, and orders.

Authentication: Create secure sign-up and login flows for users.

Database Design: Plan out how the data will be structured and stored in MongoDB.

Backend Development: Get the server side of things running smoothly with Node.js and Express.

Frontend: Use React to build a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Key Concepts We'll Cover

MERN Stack Breakdown: Learn how each part (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) fits into the puzzle.

API Building 101: Create endpoints for things like logging in, managing products, and handling orders.

Designing Databases: Sketch out data models and relationships in MongoDB.

Authentication Matters: Protect sensitive parts of the app and manage who gets access to what.

Milestone2 Project overview
A simple and resoponsive login page using react.

Features
User-Friendly Design: Clean and responsive interface optimized for various screen sizes. Interactive Inputs: Includes interactive input fields for username/email and password. Client-Side Validation: Validates user inputs for required fields and basic patterns.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface. CSS: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness. JavaScript (ES6): Adding interactivity and validation logic within React.

Milestone 3
This project demonstartes a server application that connects to a database, implements JWT-based authentication, and uses structured error handling.

##Features
Database Connecting: Connects to a MondgoDB database using Mongoose.
JWT Authentication: Secures endpoint with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Error Handling: Centralizes error handling using custom middleware.
Scalable Structurr: Origanized folder structure for better maintainability.
Environment Variables: Senstive data is managed using .env files.
## Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JAvaScript runtime.
Express: Web framework for building RESTFUL APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB.
JsonWebToken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.
